Lifelong Learning, notes and examples
=======
Here I keep my scanned notes taken at a different point in my life. This includes information from courses, books, videos and podcasts I digested. Feel free to use or copy (link to original repo is appreciated but not required).  

In addition there is some code that either solves some problem or illustrates certain approaches or algorithms (aparently not production ready).
